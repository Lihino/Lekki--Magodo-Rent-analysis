# Lekki--Magodo-Rent-analysis
Analyzing the rent rate of both Lekki and Magodo


##The Story: “Where Are the Most Budget-Friendly Modern Homes in Lagos?” Project Background: While analyzing rental data for Syncurve Homes, I discovered an interesting pattern certain mid-tier neighborhoods were consistently offering modern apartments with top features (like security, parking, and proximity to transport) for 20–30% less than comparable areas. Yet these neighborhoods weren’t as popular or featured in listings. Insight & Positioning: I framed the insight around “hidden soft-life” for renters—focusing on affordability and modern living. We created a story that highlighted The top 5 underrated but affordable neighborhoods in Lagos. A “value for money” score based on rent vs. amenities. Trends showing a rise in demand for these areas. Headline Pitch Example: “Why More Renters Are Skipping Lekki and Finding Better Deals in Magodo” How It Was Shared: Instagram carousel post showing the top 5 areas with rent visuals and cost comparisons. A blog-style article on Syncurve’s site with charts and short client testimonials from those neighborhoods. What Happened After: The story positioned Syncurve Homes as not just a rental platform, but a brand that helps people make smarter, data-backed housing decisions.
